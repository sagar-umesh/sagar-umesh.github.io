<p>"When in doubt, choose the option that has a good cause."</p>
<p>So, I registered to ride in Pelotonia. Whatâ€™s the good cause in it, you ask?</p>
<p>By registering to ride in Peolotonia, I have now made the commitment of raising $1500 towards cancer research.</p>
<p>I have known someone very close to me who was diagnosed of a rare cancer at a very young age, he fought it with a brave heart for years, yet cancer took his life. While I can never completely understand the pain or struggle many other brave people like him go through, I can only try to imagine how hard it could get for them to keep fighting.</p>
<p>Like myself there are about 7800 others registered to ride in Pelotonia this year, having raised $9.7 million to date. Every single dollar raised under Pelotonia will go towards life-saving cancer research at The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center. Pelotonia has raised over $130 million for cancer research since its inception in 2008.</p>
<p>Having decided to ride in Pelotonia, and joining hands with many other fellow riders with the same goal brings me joy and pushes me to be hopeful that we are on our way to end cancer one day.</p>
<p>On 4th of August, I will be riding 45 miles from Columbus to New Albany for Pelotonia officially, and most likely further back home to Columbus from New Albany, which will make the total distance to about 60 miles. I wanted to ride the longest route of Pelotonia (180 miles), but longer route means commitment to raise more funds, and it felt that $1500 is a good start.</p>
<p>Those of you who know me, even a little, know how passionate I am towards cycling. But when it goes beyond just the passion towards the sport to something of far more importance that Pelotonia is - it assumes an emotional significance.</p>
<p>I have always wanted to contribute back to the society in some way. This fund raiser is probably my first significant step in that path. </p>
<p>Before I ask for your help, I have made a self donation of $50 to kickstart this campaign. I have $1450 more to raise.</p>
<p>Please help me in this good cause by donating as much or as little as you can using the link below. <li><a href="http://www.pelotonia.org/sagar_umesh">pelotonia.org/sagar_umesh</a></li> </p>
            <p>Every single dollar counts.</p>
